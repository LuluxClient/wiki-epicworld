Monthly events are run by the staff team, and last varying amounts of time depending on the event. Below are a list of known events.

### <mark style="color:green;">Build Battle</mark>

The Build Battle is a monthly event, which encourages players to use their creativity to compete against one another in a time-limited building frenzy. It typically lasts for ten days, where builders are able to work out every imperfection based on the build theme. Once building is over, the vote period begins, and typically lasts for three days.

The top three builds will win a hefty amount of Gems for their hard work!

## <mark style="color:green;">Holiday Events</mark>

Various holiday events can occur in-game, accompanied by their own crates & keys in spawn. Confirmed events include:

* Valentine's Day

These events can include unique dungeons, custom armor & weapons, pets, and more! Event's like the Valentine Event also have Leaderboards, where players can compete to win Titles and Gems.

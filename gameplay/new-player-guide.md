# New Player Guide

## <mark style="color:green;">You've just logged in..</mark>

It's 8:00pm. You're done your homework, or perhaps you've put the kids to bed, and you're ready to sit down and play some EpicWorld. But.. wait, *what do you do*? After all, you skipped the tutorial!

Never fear, for our New Player Guide is here!

### <mark style="color:green;">Getting Started</mark>

Getting started in EpicWorld is basically the same as base Minecraft. You want to collect resources, start (or join) a town, and get yourself into a nice set of armor. Shoot, throw in a weapon while you're at it!

Before you get too far in, Mending is rather difficult to find! Villager trading is disabled, so you have to either fish for Enchanted Books, Vote (<mark style="color:green;">**/vote**</mark>), or trade with other players to obtain Mending.

Because of this, we recommend starting off with a nice set of Enchanted Diamond Armor, with an Enchanted Diamond Sword to get you started on your journey. Easy to repair, and equally as easy to replace in EpicWorld!

Now, where do we make a town, or gather our resources?

The Resource World is the best place to gather resources for your journey. To access the different worlds use <mark style="color:green;">**/world**</mark>, and select the one you want to hop into. You can then freely explore, and even use <mark style="color:green;">**/rtp**</mark> to teleport to a random location!

{% hint style="info" %}
The resource world resets periodically. It is *not* a good place to build, as you will lose all your building and construction progress by doing so.
{% endhint %}

The Builder World is where you want to make a town. You can choose a Country via <mark style="color:green;">**/country**</mark>, and teleport to the build world at any time via the <mark style="color:green;">**/world**</mark> menu.

To create a town, use <mark style="color:green;">**/v create [town name]**</mark> while standing in an unoccupied section of the build world. Please ensure you are *at least* five chunks from any other town by using <mark style="color:green;">**/v map**</mark>. That being said, the further you are away from other towns, the better! You want a lot of space to be able to expand, as you can claim up to *400 chunks* in total for your town.

You can head back to your town at any time by using <mark style="color:green;">**/v home**</mark>!

### <mark style="color:green;">Obtaining a Class</mark>

So now you've created (or joined) a town, got some armor, and a nice weapon. How do you get a Class?

Class cards can be obtained via various methods. But really, what's the fastest method? After all, you want to get in some dungeons!

<mark style="color:green;">**/store**</mark> offers five free common class cards per day. These can be Warrior, Archer, Bard, or Mage cards depending on the day!

You can also obtain Random Class Card Packs from <mark style="color:green;">**/rewards**</mark> once per day, after three hours online, and from <mark style="color:green;">**/afk**</mark> by spending twelve hours in the AFK zone!

Now you've got a Class. To select it, use at least one of your Class Cards (hold it and right or left-click), then use <mark style="color:green;">**/class**</mark> to enter the Class Menu. Click on the class you want to play, and then hit the 'Select' button in the menu for that class.

Now to obtain even more class cards, jump into the next section.. *dungeons*!

{% hint style="info" %}
You automatically have the basic attack for that class unlocked at Level 1. You do not need to equip it, and will perform the basic attack simply by swinging at an enemy with a sword (or custom weapon).
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:green;">Dungeons</mark>

Well.. well.. well. Look what we have here. A borderline seasoned adventurer.. *borderline*.

You want to join the ranks of real adventurers? Now you have to run Dungeons. To enter dungeons you need Dungeon Teleport Stones. You can obtain Common Dungeon Teleport Stones from <mark style="color:green;">**/kit dungeon**</mark> and <mark style="color:green;">**/dscrolls**</mark>.

Dungeon Scrolls (dscrolls) are quests that you complete to earn a Dungeon Teleport Stone. Buying the scrolls from /dscrolls costs Minecraft XP. For your ten available daily scrolls you need approximately eighty-five (85) Minecraft Levels.

An easy way to earn these is to go to a public XP farm (see <mark style="color:green;">**/pwarps**</mark> or the wiki section on The Warps for more information). 

Once you have your stones, you can start the dungeon by either right or left-clicking with the Dungeon Stone in your hand. You'll also want to invite people to run the dungeon with you! So while you're in the dungeon lobby, here's a couple of commands that'll help you out:

* /party invite [name]: Invites the specified person to your dungeon party. **(*Max of 4 Players per Dungeon*)**
* /party disband: Disbands the dungeon group.
* /dungeon start: Starts the dungeon.

Let's reiterate it here. There is a **Max of 4 Players per Dungeon**. If you get a 5th person involved and start the dungeon, you're running the risk of getting your account sanctioned.

Running dungeons will level your Class, which increases your stats, as well as allowing you to unlock new skills. At the end of each dungeon, assuming you are still alive, you may loot the chests for rewards (see the Dungeons section of the wiki).

### <mark style="color:green;">Jobs & Ranks</mark>

The last thing we'll run over quicky is Jobs (<mark style="color:green;">**/jobs**</mark>). Leveling these is vital to Ranking Up, which is a huge quality of life boost to your progression.

Ranks let you access more Towns, create more Player Shops to sell your goods, list more items on the Auction House, and even access some commands that can help you out!

Jobs themselves also provide rewards for leveling up, which can include pets, adventure scrolls, Gems, and more!

Not only that, but as you Rank Up you look way cooler than that guy with the Rookie tag next to his name.

### <mark style="color:green;">Obtaining Gems</mark>

Gems are a currency that can be earned in game, or by spending real money. These can be used to unlock Paid Ranks with big perks, purchase keys in <mark style="color:green;">**/store**</mark> to open crates in <mark style="color:green;">**/spawn**</mark>, or even to snatch up a Legendary Class card when it pops up in the rotating store rotation!

What's that? You want to know the free ways to earn Gems? Well.. I probably shouldn't tell you this.. *but lets do it anyway*.

Gems can be earned from the following sources in-game:

* Job Level Rewards (<mark style="color:green;">**/jobs**</mark>)
* Events
* The monthly pass (<mark style="color:green;">**/pass**</mark>)
* By AFK'ing in the AFK Zone (<mark style="color:green;">**/afk**</mark>)
* Adventure Scroll Rewards
* Daily Vote Rewards (<mark style="color:green;">**/vote**</mark>)
* Weekly Vote Rewards (<mark style="color:green;">**/vote**</mark> under Tiers)
* Boosting the Discord Server (available twice per month)

To add onto the above, Events can be especially lucrative sources of Gems. For example, the Build Battle event has provided 5000 gems to the 1st place winner, 3500 gems to 2nd place, and 2000 gems to  3rd place.

This is a great reason to keep an eye out for any events that are posted in Discord, to see what you may be able to win!

That wraps up our New Player Guide. If you have other questions, there's a good chance they are answered in the other sections of the Wiki! If they aren't you can always ask in-game or in the Discord, and staff are always happy to help!

# ⚙️ Town Settings
When creating your town, you have a multitude of settings and features available to you. To change them as you wish, simply use the <mark style="color:green;">**`/v`**</mark> or <mark style="color:green;">**`/town`**</mark> command to access the town features menu.

## <mark style="color:green;">Town Features Menu</mark>

The town menu has 8 clickable buttons, each offering specific functionality:

### <mark style="color:green;">Member</mark>

This button allows you to manage your towns members. You can view the list of current members, invite new members, and manage roles.

To manage different roles in your town, hover over the character you want to change, then shift + left-click to promote or shift + right-click to dismiss.

### <mark style="color:green;">Miscellaneous</mark>

This button provides a variety of features for your town.

You can edit the town description, view sent invitations, and change the town name.

### <mark style="color:green;">Sub Area's</mark>

{% content-ref url="sub-areas.md" %}
[sub-areas.md](sub-areas.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Sub area's allow you to create areas within your town that have separate permissions from the rest of the town. Want people to fly in certain areas, or to ride minecarts, but not in other areas? You can manage that here!

### <mark style="color:green;">Teleportation</mark>

This button teleports to <mark style="color:green;">**`/v home`**</mark>your town's spawn point. This makes it easier for town members to travel quickly.

### <mark style="color:green;">Bank</mark>

The bank is where you store funds, which can be used to either expand your town's claims, or to pay taxes for your town. Players can use /v bank deposit [amount] to deposit funds, or /v bank withdraw [amount] to withdraw funds.

### <mark style="color:green;">Role</mark>

This button is essential for managing roles in your town. You can create, edit, and delete roles, as well as assign specific permissions (Actions and Management) to each role to control members' actions.

### <mark style="color:green;">Level</mark>

{% content-ref url="town-levels.md" %}
[town-levels.md](town-levels.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

This is the level of your town. Your town's level dictates how many chunks you can claim for your town, with higher town levels costing more to unlock.

### <mark style="color:green;">**World Setting**</mark>

This button allows you to manage various town settings that affect the game environment. You can adjust settings such as animal spawning, whether players can open doors, and other aspects to customize the game experience in your town.

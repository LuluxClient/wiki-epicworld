# ‚úÇÔ∏è Sub-Areas

Sub-areas allow you to create separate areas within your town, where you can enable different sets of permissions for visitors, citizens, etc. This can be creatively used to show off builds, let players explore your shops, or even to allocate specific areas for each town member! 

First, make sure you are the mayor of the town you want to create the zone for. Otherwise, make sure the mayor has given you all the necessary permissions for this.

### <mark style="color:green;">Step 1</mark>

Open the town menu via the command <mark style="color:green;">**`/town`**</mark> and click on the ‚ÄúSub-Areas‚Äù tab, then on ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù.

### <mark style="color:green;">Step 2</mark>

Following this action, a golden hoe will appear in your inventory. This hoe is used to demarcate the sub-area you wish to create.

The first left click with the hoe determines the first position, while the first right click marks the second (and final) position.

This will allow you to create a cubic area with a point A and a point B.

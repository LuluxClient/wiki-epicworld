# üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è The Warps

## <mark style="color:green;">General Information</mark>

PlayerWarp is a core feature on our server that allows players to create their own custom teleport points, called warps.

These warps can be used to quickly travel across the world and facilitate exploration and trade.

## <mark style="color:green;">Usefulness of Warps</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">**Trade and Commerce:**</mark> By creating warps to specific locations such as markets, shops, or trading areas, players can simplify their trade transactions.
* <mark style="color:green;">**City Management:**</mark> Town members can use warps to allow their citizens to easily travel to key locations in the city, such as town halls, arenas, or community farms.
    * This can also include opening public services, such as Exp Farms, to the public for use.
